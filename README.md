# 76107ComparativeGenreAnalysis

This repository houses the code for reproducing the figures for my Comparative Genre Analysis paper in my 76-107 Writing About Data course at CMU. The code is in [Analysis.R](https://github.com/9Dread/76107ComparativeGenreAnalysis/blob/main/Analysis.R). All data in [Data](https://github.com/9Dread/76107ComparativeGenreAnalysis/tree/main/Data) was downloaded from the [DocuScopeCAC tool](https://github.com/browndw/docuscope-cac).
